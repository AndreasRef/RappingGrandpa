Grandpa is an old school hiphop bot that utilises RiTA and WordNet for generating rhymes in direct response to user inputs. Grandpa’s style is leaned back and dirty, and his rhymes are complex and surprising.

The visuals are written in Processing: Simple lines react to the music in real time using Processing’s Minims library.
